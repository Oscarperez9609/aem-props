# AEM Components / Sightly - AEM React

In this repository you'll find two folders in which I expose components worked on the Sightly and React AEM frameworks

## About
Sightly:
- FAQ and configuratorLite are components based on AEM Sightly, which allow the author to create forms for requests or complaints. In the example code, FAQ contains clientLibs which have libraries that allow you to use a customization layer based on colorPickerUI to use color palette style styles.
- ConfiguratorLite is a tool that allows you to modify options to select or customize a vehicle of the corresponding brand. This component is divided into several sections, however I upload an initial part to show the structure of the .content and clientLibs.

AEM React:
- The BR banner is a component that allows the author to create a banner composed of an image type background, a title, a description, a button which can be configured using resourceType: colorfield, a side resource that can be a video or image. which include a checkbox for this.
- BlogHead is a component to create the header of a blog or article. The author can upload the background, the title and when these items are loaded, the code in ui.frontend takes the url data to automatically create a hyperlink breadcrumb above the title.
